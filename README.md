# CS370-Project
AI pirate search game using Python

1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

   1. within the program I was given the GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py files. I was also given the main Project file, with the qtrain method needing to be completed. The code I developed runs the game, keeping track of useful information and providing the feedback to the AI. Over time, the "pirate" learns the maze and can easily solve it faster than a player can. 

3. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

     1. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  
        1. Computer scientists create programs and tools for a broad range of fields and issues. Within this class we learned about Artificial Intelligence and it's potential within our society. Ultimately, Computer scientists seek to create ethical programs than can simplify tasks or create a solution for problems that we can't do without it. 

     3. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  
        1. Many computer science questions involve a lot of trial and error to find a correct answer, but like many other things there are always more than one answer. I tend to try to throw myself at a problem and go as far as I can on my own before looking into resources to better understand what I don't. CS is a field that requires a lot of research and looking at others work to understand how to do things, with the key being to /understand/ it, not just blindly copy others work. Understanding how it works allows you to use the code properly, but recognize other ways it can be achieved.

     5. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  
        1. Ethics are a major concern in computer science, especially in AI development. Programs themselves cannot choose to be biased, but their creators can create them to be biases, intentionally or not. It's important to design programs that take into account others situations or disabilites. This can be simple things like design decisions; Is the text on the page easy to read? Do you have options to change it for those who have issues? do you have text to speech options? These are "small" things that may not affect the developer, but may affect many people who view the application. When it comes to AI, it's important to take into account the information you train it with, especially when it can directly affect the lives of others.
